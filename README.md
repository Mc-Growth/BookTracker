# Book Tracker

This is a tool that calculates how long it will take to read a specified number of books over a given timeframe.

## Usage

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `wpm` variable to reflect your reading speed in words per minute. See this video by Tim Ferris to calculate your reading speed (link)
2. Edit the `pagesPerBook` (e.g B1P) variables to reflect the number of pages in each book you want to read. The first 12 have already being filled in from Lex's list on twitter. If you wanted too add a new book you would edit the line (double B13P =  0 * wpp) replacing 0 with the number of pages in yout book.
3. Edit the `TimeFrame` variable to reflect the length of the timeframe you want to track. Options are `annual`, `biannual`, `quarterly`, or `monthly`. This has being set to annual by defualt but can be changed on line x
4. Run the program on your desired IDE and it will output the total time it will take to read the specified number of books at the given reading speed.


## Note

This tool is intended for rough estimates only and does not take into account factors such as vacation time or other interruptions. The actual time it takes to read the books may be slighltly different.
